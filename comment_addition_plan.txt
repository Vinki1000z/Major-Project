Comment Addition Plan for All Python Files

Information Gathered:
- data.py: Contains data fetching, preprocessing functions, and a PyTorch Dataset class. Has good docstrings but can use some inline comments for clarity.
- main.py: Tkinter GUI application for stock prediction. Has some inline comments but could benefit from more comments explaining UI structure and key functions.
- model.py: Defines TemporalFusionTransformer model using PyTorch Lightning. Has class and file docstrings, some inline comments in training_step.
- news.py: Fetches news articles using Marketaux API. Has file and function docstrings, could use inline comments for API call and error handling.
- predict.py: Contains run_prediction function for full prediction pipeline. Has detailed docstrings, could use inline comments for key steps.
- polygon_test.py: Simple test script for polygon.io data fetch. No comments currently.
- plot.py: Plotting module for actual vs predicted prices in Tkinter canvas. Has docstrings but no inline comments.

Plan:
- Add a brief file-level comment if missing or enhance existing.
- Add or enhance function docstrings if needed.
- Add inline comments explaining key steps, especially in:
  - data.py: data fetching, preprocessing, dataset indexing
  - main.py: UI layout, event handlers, threading
  - model.py: training_step, validation_step, optimizer config
  - news.py: API request, response parsing, error handling
  - predict.py: data fetching fallback, training loop, prediction calculation
  - polygon_test.py: test function steps
  - plot.py: plotting steps and Tkinter embedding

Dependent Files to be Edited:
- data.py
- main.py
- model.py
- news.py
- predict.py
- polygon_test.py
- plot.py

Follow-up Steps:
- Verify comments do not alter code functionality.
- Run the application to ensure no runtime errors.
- Review comments for clarity and helpfulness.

Please confirm if you approve this plan to proceed with adding comments.
